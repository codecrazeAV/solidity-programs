This is the repository for all solidity programs that I have done so far. I have done all those programs on Remix IDE. Programs are done according to what I have learnt from metacrafters modules and their assignmentns. 
assignment 1 is named as myfirstcontract.sol in this assignment I have build 4 variables and implemented set and get function for them.

assignment 2 is named as ethervaluecoverter.sol in this assignent user can pass any amount which should be in wei unit and in return he will get his 
amount in gwei, ether and wei.

assignment 3 is named as basicop.sol in this assignment I have implemented few basic operations like addition, substraction, multiplication and devision
in solidity.

Final assignment is named as myfirsttoken.sol, in this I have created a contract and inside that contract I have created a token named
coinVajrastra and this token has 2 most basic functionalities of a token which is burn and mint function which can increment balance of an
address with value passed into the mint function and deduct token amount with the value passed in the burn function.
